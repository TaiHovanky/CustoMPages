# CustoMPages

MPages are used in the Cerner Millennium system to allow clinicians to have a quick, convenient view of their patients' data. This makes it easier for them to make informed decisions even when time is of essence. My goal is to create MPages that display relevant clinical data in an easy to read format.

This project consumes Cerner's new open API, which allows clients to access various pieces of patient data (encounter data, observations, diagnoses, etc.). All of my work is done in a sandbox environment that provides test patient data.

As of 11/2, I've built one MPage that contains inpatient observation data. I intend on expanding on its capabilities, and then building other pages to display different types of data.
